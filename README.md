## Idea
The idea behind this is to have a "kind of photobooth" experience at events at home or in normal life. 
Since everybody has a camera in their pocket I wanted to use this fact to create a nicer atmosphere during gatherings with friends. 

The principle is simple: 
  1) take a picture
  2) send it to a telegram bot 
  3) telegram bot handles the data and saves it 
  4) screen on the wall displays these photos in real time with a seperate web application
  5) laugh at funny pictures taken during a friendly gathering with friends

## Basic usage
A telegram bot which distributes pictures to a owner/creator of a group. These pictures are then hosted on a website with authentication for the owner/creator of said group in form of a photoslider.
(Hosting part is not in this project)

## How it works:
1) A user may create his own group and invite users from a active user pool to his group.
2) All users in a given group may send pictures to one of the groups they are part of.
3) Pictures will be saved to the receipients diskspace on server
4) This pictures will be hosted with a seperate web application for the owner of the group.
